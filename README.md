# python_jetbrains_academy

This repository showcases six foundational projects I completed while learning **Python** through **JetBrains Academy**, starting in early 2022, a journey that took me about six months. Python quickly became a passion of mine due to its incredible versatility and wide range of applications.

### What I Achieved

* **Six hands-on programming projects:** These projects allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.
* **Hundreds of coding challenges:** Sharpened my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of Python concepts.
* **Mastery of over 60 diverse topics:** Built a strong, comprehensive foundation in the language.

### Why Python?

While I had a brief introduction to Python during my university physics studies (using libraries like SciPy), it didn't fully click then. The structured approach of the JetBrains Academy course, however, truly opened my eyes to Python's potential.

This journey was a pivotal step, enabling me to explore and leverage tools like **Selenium**, which perfectly aligns with my expertise in **Quality Assurance** and passion for automation and scripting.
