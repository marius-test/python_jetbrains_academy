This repository showcases six foundational projects I completed during my skill development in **Python** through **JetBrains Academy**, starting in early 2022, a journey lasting about six months. Python programming became one of my passions due to its versatility and broad real-world applications.

### What I Achieved

- **Eight hands-on projects:** Applied theoretical knowledge to real-world problems.
- **Hundreds of coding challenges:** Strengthened problem-solving skills and deepened understanding of Python.
- **Over 60 topics mastered:** Built a solid and comprehensive foundation in the language.

### Why Python?

I was introduced to Python during my university studies as a physics student, using libraries like SciPy and NumPy. Although it didnâ€™t stick with me at the time, I saw its potential.

This journey was a pivotal step, allowing me to explore and leverage tools like Selenium, which align well with my expertise in Quality Assurance and my passion for automation and scripting.
